	<p>gonna go to my friends' show, and the picnic, and a housewarming party</p>
	<p>might hyperventilate in my room for a bit</p>
	<p>call mom</p>
	<p />
	<p>i realize i don't have much of a thesis here</p>
	<p>that's kinda the point</p>
	<p>things are so bad and undoubtedly will get worse</p>
	<p>and i just need to put that thought somewhere outside my head</p>
	<p />
	<p>i also haven't mentioned how fucking cool trans people are</p>
	<p>
		i found out the other day that the picnic i helped start gets talked about all the way in
		chicago
	</p>
	<p>we're all like two degrees of separation from each other</p>
	<p>and make a ton of cool art</p>
	<p>all our shit filters up through the culture, and these bastards want us dead</p>
	<p />
	<p>my mom's really sweet about it</p>
	<p>she goes on these mini rants about how she can't imagine how people could hate us</p>
	<p>how we're all so thoughtful and empathetic</p>
	<p>and how we literally magically transform</p>
	<p>big mom fan</p>
	<p />
	<p>i think i'll leave it at that</p>
	<p>this is all exhausting and bad etc</p>
	<p>gonna have to fight</p>
	<p />
	<p>anyways, go learn the home addresses of your local politicians and ceos</p>
